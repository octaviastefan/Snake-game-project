Through this project, I want to create a version of the famous Snake game, well-known, played, and loved by many generations, using basic ardunino uno kit and materials. 

The idea for this project came from the desire to develop my own version of the first game I ever played many years ago on a Nokia phone. Of course, this game will be created using the components and knowledge I currently have. It may not be perfect, but I find it interesting and useful, and I am sure it will evoke nostalgia and fond memories for quite a few people.

  ##
  
This Snake Game on Arduino is a project that uses an 8x8 LED matrix to display the snake, an LCD screen to show game information like the score, and a joystick for controlling the snake's movement. The game also includes sound effects via a buzzer, and a menu system to navigate through different game options.

 -   Joystick (controls the snake's movement)
 -   Buzzer (for sound effects based on game actions)
 -   Potentiometer (LCD)
 -   LCD (Displays game-related information such as the score, game status, orÂ instructions.)
 -   Jumper Cables

  <summary> <h2> Software Design </h2> </summary>

  ##
  ### Development enviroment:
  
  I will use the PlatformIO IDE extension.
  ##
  ##
 ### The libraries used in the code :
  - LedControl.h
    
This library is used to control the 8x8 LED matrix connected through the MAX7219 driver.

Why did I use this library?

1.It simplifies managing LED matrices.

2.It provides functions like setLed() and setRow() to easily turn LEDs on or off.

3.It allows us to adjust brightness with setIntensity() and clear the display with clearDisplay().

 - LiquidCrystal.h

This library is used to control an LCD display.

Why did I use this library?

To display game information such as score and menu on an LCD.

 - Arduino.h
   
   The core library that provides essential functions for the project.
