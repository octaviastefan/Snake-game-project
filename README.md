Through this project, I want to create a version of the famous Snake game, well-known, played, and loved by many generations, using basic ardunino uno kit and materials. 

The idea for this project came from the desire to develop my own version of the first game I ever played many years ago on a Nokia phone. Of course, this game will be created using the components and knowledge I currently have. It may not be perfect, but I find it interesting and useful, and I am sure it will evoke nostalgia and fond memories for quite a few people.

  ##
  
The Snake game is probably the most intuitive and easy to play game in the world. Basically, the snake must eat as much food as possible without hitting itself. At the beginning of the game, as well as the first level, the snake starts small. As it eats, it grows, and along with it, the score increases. Naturally, the game also becomes more challenging.
